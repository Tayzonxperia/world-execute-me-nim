[00:00.03] Switch on the power line 
[00:01.33] Remember to put on protection
[00:03.58] Lay down your pieces
[00:05.16] And let's begin object creation
[00:07.19] Fill in my data parameters
[00:09.75] Initialization
[00:10.90] Set up our new world
[00:12.47] And let's begin the simulation
[00:16.04] 
[00:29.28] If I'm a set of point
[00:30.89] Then I will give you my dimension
[00:33.01] If I'm a circle
[00:34.54] Then I will give you my circumference
[00:36.77] If I'm a sine wave
[00:38.27] Then you can sit on all my tangents
[00:40.36] If I approach infinity
[00:41.92] Then you can be my limitations
[00:44.04] Switch my current
[00:45.52] To AC, to DC
[00:47.27] And then blind my vision
[00:49.11] So dizzy, so dizzy
[00:50.95] Oh, we can travel
[00:52.99] To AD, to BC
[00:54.74] And we can unite
[00:56.79] So deeply, so deeply
[00:58.65] If I can, if I can
[01:00.57] Give you all the simulations
[01:02.41] Then I can, then I can
[01:04.29] Be your only satisfaction
[01:06.17] If I can make you happy
[01:07.99] I will run the execution
[01:10.02] Though we are trapped
[01:11.20] In this strange, strange simulation
[01:13.53] If I'm an eggplant
[01:15.29] Then I will give you my nutrients
[01:17.16] If I'm a tomato
[01:18.93] Then I will give you antioxidants
[01:20.93] If I'm a tabby cat
[01:22.56] Then I will purr for your enjoyment
[01:24.60] If I'm the only God
[01:26.21] Then you're the proof of my existence
[01:28.34] Switch my gender
[01:29.91] To F, to M
[01:31.44] And then do whatever
[01:33.52] From AM to PM
[01:35.28] Oh, switch my role
[01:37.32] To S, to M
[01:38.93] So we can enter
[01:40.93] The trance, the trance
[01:42.93] If I can, if I can
[01:44.92] Feel your vibrations
[01:46.74] Then I can, then I can
[01:48.69] Finally be completion
[01:50.30] Though you have left
[01:51.98] You have left
[01:52.89] You have left
[01:53.75] You have left
[01:54.65] You have left
[01:55.60] You have left me in isolation
[01:57.95] If I can, if I can
[01:59.81] Erase all the pointless fragments
[02:01.80] Then maybe, then maybe
[02:03.55] You won't leave me so disheartened
[02:05.33] Challenging your God
[02:08.42] You have made some
[02:10.74] Illegal arguments
[02:14.38] 
[02:27.48] Execution, execution
[02:29.14] Execution, execution
[02:31.19] Execution, execution
[02:32.94] Execution, execution
[02:34.84] Execution, execution
[02:36.69] Execution, execution
[02:38.79] Ein, dos
[02:39.66] Trois, ne
[02:40.45] Fem, liu
[02:41.31] Execution
[02:42.23] If I can, if I can
[02:44.07] Give them all the execution
[02:46.05] Then I can, then I can
[02:47.75] Be your only execution
[02:49.61] If I can have you back
[02:51.77] I will run the execution
[02:53.11] Though we are trapped
[02:54.80] We are trapped, ah
[02:56.96] I've studied, I've studied
[02:58.79] How to properly lo-o-ove
[03:00.78] Question me, question me
[03:02.43] I can answer all lo-o-ove
[03:04.33] I know the algebraic expression of lo-o-ove
[03:07.97] Though you are free
[03:09.26] I am trapped
[03:10.24] Trapped in lo-o-ove
[03:13.46] 
[03:25.56] Execution
[03:26.30]
